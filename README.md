guten-starter
---------

Gutenstarter is a small standalone [Gutenberg editor](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg) JavaScript starter app. The inserted content is outputted to the console by using `console.log(blocks)`. Save that logged array somewhere in your app maybe.

**What are other standalone Gutenberg editor solutions?**

**Why am I developing this solution?**  
Other options are outdated or unclear. My intention with this project is to make a straightforward starter app that will kick-start you into integrating Gutenberg editor into your app.
