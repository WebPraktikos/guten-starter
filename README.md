Gutenstarter
---------

**Attention:** Still at an early stage of development; lacking in basic styling.

Gutenstarter is a small standalone [Gutenberg editor](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg) JavaScript starter app. The inserted content is outputted to the console by using `console.log(blocks)`. You can save that logged array and then the magic can start. Note that it uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

**What are other standalone Gutenberg editor solutions?**

**Why am I developing this solution?**  
Other options are outdated or unclear. My intention with this project is to make a straightforward starter app that will kickstart you into integrating Gutenberg editor into your app.
